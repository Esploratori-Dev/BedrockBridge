# BedrockBridge
BedrockBridge is a discord bot that connects your discord-server to your bedrock-server. This solution is specifically for BDS (Bedrock Dedicated Server) but it can also be used on any bedrock server. All you need to do in order to use this bot is [inviting](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1041838898843762769&permissions=2684357632&scope=bot%20applications.commands) the bot to your discord-server, and installing the addon in your bedrock-server. That's all you need to do. (check #installing for more details about this procedure).

2. Choose the channel you want to have bedrock-chat streamed to and run `/setup` in it
3. Request a new token by running `/new-token`. Keep it safe.
### Bedrock setup
4. Download *BedrockBridge_worldpack.mcpack*, and add it to your minecraft launcher, by double clicking it.
5. Open your world's settings (from minecraft launcher), add the pack and **enable** experimental features (now called **beta API**).

*note: if you are not doing this on a new world (from *new world* settings menu) and you didn't have experiments enabled, mc generated a copy of your world with experiments enabled. THIS is the world you need to use from now on (not the original version).*
